the following things have still not yet been tested:
1.candle pattern regconize
2.MA Simulation needs more fractional, and try to make use of all cash


top conference:
https://www.aminer.org/ranks/conf/database-and-data-mining
top conference & journal:
http://data-mining.philippe-fournier-viger.com/the-top-journals-and-conferences-in-data-mining-data-science/

what issue to be addressed:
1.classification problem on data
    but NEED neural networks to solve this...

2.optimization for parameters for technical analysis

About the journal or top conference:
1.Ask Wang Dejiang
but what i need is computer science field

Seems like i have to search top conference articles randomly to find new models and new techs which can be applied to my model.

Focus on Data Classification Problem

Use https://scholar.google.com/ advanced Search, you can search articles of specific conference

Articles to read:
Auto-WEKA: combined selection and hyperparameter optimization of classification algorithms



A method to express the trend:
A = EMA18 / EMA50
B = EMA50 / EMA100
C = EMA100 / EMA200
Trend = A*B*C
